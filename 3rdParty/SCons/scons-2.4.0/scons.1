.SH "NAME"
scons \- a software construction tool
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP \w'\fBscons\fR\ 'u
\fBscons\fR [\fIoptions\fR...] [\fIname=val\fR...] [\fItargets\fR...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBscons\fR
utility builds software (or other files) by determining which component pieces must be rebuilt and executing the necessary commands to rebuild them\&.
.PP
By default,
\fBscons\fR
searches for a file named
\fISConstruct\fR,
\fISconstruct\fR, or
\fIsconstruct\fR
(in that order) in the current directory and reads its configuration from the first file found\&. An alternate file name may be specified via the
\fB\-f\fR
option\&.
.PP
The
\fISConstruct\fR
file can specify subsidiary configuration files using the
\fBSConscript\fR() function\&. By convention, these subsidiary files are named
\fISConscript\fR, although any name may be used\&. (Because of this naming convention, the term "SConscript files" is sometimes used to refer generically to all
\fBscons\fR
configuration files, regardless of actual file name\&.)
.PP
The configuration files specify the target files to be built, and (optionally) the rules to build those targets\&. Reasonable default rules exist for building common software components (executable programs, object files, libraries), so that for most software projects, only the target and input files need be specified\&.
.PP
Before reading the
\fISConstruct\fR
file,
\fBscons\fR
looks for a directory named
\fIsite_scons\fR
in various system directories (see below) and the directory containing the
\fISConstruct\fR
file; for each of those dirs which exists,
\fIsite_scons\fR
is prepended to sys\&.path, the file
\fIsite_scons/site_init\&.py\fR, is evaluated if it exists, and the directory
\fIsite_scons/site_tools\fR
is prepended to the default toolpath if it exists\&. See the
\fB\-\-no\-site\-dir\fR
and
\fB\-\-site\-dir\fR
options for more details\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
reads and executes the SConscript files as Python scripts, so you may use normal Python scripting capabilities (such as flow control, data manipulation, and imported Python libraries) to handle complicated build situations\&.
\fBscons\fR, however, reads and executes all of the SConscript files
\fIbefore\fR
it begins building any targets\&. To make this obvious,
\fBscons\fR
prints the following messages about what it is doing:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ scons foo\&.out
scons: Reading SConscript files \&.\&.\&.
scons: done reading SConscript files\&.
scons: Building targets  \&.\&.\&.
cp foo\&.in foo\&.out
scons: done building targets\&.
$
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The status messages (everything except the line that reads "cp foo\&.in foo\&.out") may be suppressed using the
\fB\-Q\fR
option\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
does not automatically propagate the external environment used to execute
\fBscons\fR
to the commands used to build target files\&. This is so that builds will be guaranteed repeatable regardless of the environment variables set at the time
\fBscons\fR
is invoked\&. This also means that if the compiler or other commands that you want to use to build your target files are not in standard system locations,
\fBscons\fR
will not find them unless you explicitly set the PATH to include those locations\&. Whenever you create an
\fBscons\fR
construction environment, you can propagate the value of PATH from your external environment as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {\*(AqPATH\*(Aq : os\&.environ[\*(AqPATH\*(Aq]})
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Similarly, if the commands use external environment variables like $PATH, $HOME, $JAVA_HOME, $LANG, $SHELL, $TERM, etc\&., these variables can also be explicitly propagated:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV = {\*(AqPATH\*(Aq : os\&.environ[\*(AqPATH\*(Aq],
                         \*(AqHOME\*(Aq : os\&.environ[\*(AqHOME\*(Aq]})
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Or you may explicitly propagate the invoking user\*(Aqs complete external environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import os
env = Environment(ENV = os\&.environ)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This comes at the expense of making your build dependent on the user\*(Aqs environment being set correctly, but it may be more convenient for many configurations\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
can scan known input files automatically for dependency information (for example, #include statements in C or C++ files) and will rebuild dependent files appropriately whenever any "included" input file changes\&.
\fBscons\fR
supports the ability to define new scanners for unknown input file types\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
knows how to fetch files automatically from SCCS or RCS subdirectories using SCCS, RCS or BitKeeper\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
is normally executed in a top\-level directory containing a
\fISConstruct\fR
file, optionally specifying as command\-line arguments the target file or files to be built\&.
.PP
By default, the command
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
will build all target files in or below the current directory\&. Explicit default targets (to be built when no targets are specified on the command line) may be defined the SConscript file(s) using the
\fBDefault()\fR
function, described below\&.
.PP
Even when
\fBDefault()\fR
targets are specified in the SConscript file(s), all target files in or below the current directory may be built by explicitly specifying the current directory (\&.) as a command\-line target:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Building all target files, including any files outside of the current directory, may be specified by supplying a command\-line target of the root directory (on POSIX systems):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons /
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or the path name(s) of the volume(s) in which all the targets should be built (on Windows systems):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons C:\e D:\e
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
To build only specific targets, supply them as command\-line arguments:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons foo bar
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
in which case only the specified targets will be built (along with any derived files on which they depend)\&.
.PP
Specifying "cleanup" targets in SConscript files is not usually necessary\&. The
\fB\-c\fR
flag removes all files necessary to build the specified target:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons \-c \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
to remove all target files, or:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons \-c build export
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
to remove target files under build and export\&. Additional files or directories to remove can be specified using the
\fBClean()\fR
function\&. Conversely, targets that would normally be removed by the
\fB\-c\fR
invocation can be prevented from being removed by using the
\fBNoClean\fR() function\&.
.PP
A subset of a hierarchical tree may be built by remaining at the top\-level directory (where the
\fISConstruct\fR
file lives) and specifying the subdirectory as the target to be built:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons src/subdir
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or by changing directory and invoking scons with the
\fB\-u\fR
option, which traverses up the directory hierarchy until it finds the
\fISConstruct\fR
file, and then builds targets relatively to the current subdirectory:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
cd src/subdir
scons \-u \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fBscons\fR
supports building multiple targets in parallel via a
\fB\-j\fR
option that takes, as its argument, the number of simultaneous tasks that may be spawned:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons \-j 4
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
builds four targets in parallel, for example\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
can maintain a cache of target (derived) files that can be shared between multiple builds\&. When caching is enabled in a SConscript file, any target files built by
\fBscons\fR
will be copied to the cache\&. If an up\-to\-date target file is found in the cache, it will be retrieved from the cache instead of being rebuilt locally\&. Caching behavior may be disabled and controlled in other ways by the
\fB\-\-cache\-force\fR,
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR,
\fB\-\-cache\-readonly\fR, and
\fB\-\-cache\-show\fR
command\-line options\&. The
\fB\-\-random\fR
option is useful to prevent multiple builds from trying to update the cache simultaneously\&.
.PP
Values of variables to be passed to the SConscript file(s) may be specified on the command line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons debug=1 \&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
These variables are available in SConscript files through the ARGUMENTS dictionary, and can be used in the SConscript file(s) to modify the build in any way:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
if ARGUMENTS\&.get(\*(Aqdebug\*(Aq, 0):
    env = Environment(CCFLAGS = \*(Aq\-g\*(Aq)
else:
    env = Environment()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The command\-line variable arguments are also available in the ARGLIST list, indexed by their order on the command line\&. This allows you to process them in order rather than by name, if necessary\&. ARGLIST[0] returns a tuple containing (argname, argvalue)\&. A Python exception is thrown if you try to access a list member that does not exist\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
requires Python version 2\&.7 or later\&. There should be no other dependencies or requirements to run
\fBscons\&.\fR
.PP
By default,
\fBscons\fR
knows how to search for available programming tools on various systems\&. On Windows systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, the MinGW tool chain, the Intel compiler tools, and the PharLap ETS compiler\&. On OS/2 systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the OS/2 compiler, the GCC tool chain, and the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, On SGI IRIX, IBM AIX, Hewlett Packard HP\-UX, and Sun Solaris systems,
\fBscons\fR
searches for the native compiler tools (MIPSpro, Visual Age, aCC, and Forte tools respectively) and the GCC tool chain\&. On all other platforms, including POSIX (Linux and UNIX) platforms,
\fBscons\fR
searches in order for the GCC tool chain, the Microsoft Visual C++ tools, and the Intel compiler tools\&. You may, of course, override these default values by appropriate configuration of Environment construction variables\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
In general,
\fBscons\fR
supports the same command\-line options as GNU
\fBmake\fR, and many of those supported by
\fBcons\fR\&.
.PP
\-b
.RS 4
Ignored for compatibility with non\-GNU versions of
\fBmake\&.\fR
.RE
.PP
\-c, \-\-clean, \-\-remove
.RS 4
Clean up by removing all target files for which a construction command is specified\&. Also remove any files or directories associated to the construction command using the
\fBClean\fR() function\&. Will not remove any targets specified by the
\fBNoClean\fR() function\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-debug=\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Print debug information about the
\fBCacheDir\fR() derived\-file caching to the specified
\fIfile\fR\&. If
\fIfile\fR
is
\fB\-\fR
(a hyphen), the debug information are printed to the standard output\&. The printed messages describe what signature file names are being looked for in, retrieved from, or written to the
\fBCacheDir\fR() directory tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-disable, \-\-no\-cache
.RS 4
Disable the derived\-file caching specified by
\fBCacheDir\fR()\&.
\fBscons\fR
will neither retrieve files from the cache nor copy files to the cache\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-force, \-\-cache\-populate
.RS 4
When using
\fBCacheDir\fR(), populate a cache by copying any already\-existing, up\-to\-date derived files to the cache, in addition to files built by this invocation\&. This is useful to populate a new cache with all the current derived files, or to add to the cache any derived files recently built with caching disabled via the
\fB\-\-cache\-disable\fR
option\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-readonly
.RS 4
Use the cache (if enabled) for reading, but do not not update the cache with changed files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cache\-show
.RS 4
When using
\fBCacheDir\fR() and retrieving a derived file from the cache, show the command that would have been executed to build the file, instead of the usual report, "Retrieved `file\*(Aq from cache\&." This will produce consistent output for build logs, regardless of whether a target file was rebuilt or retrieved from the cache\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-config=\fImode\fR
.RS 4
This specifies how the
\fBConfigure\fR
call should use or generate the results of configuration tests\&. The option should be specified from among the following choices:
.RE
.PP
\-\-config=auto
.RS 4
scons will use its normal dependency mechanisms to decide if a test must be rebuilt or not\&. This saves time by not running the same configuration tests every time you invoke scons, but will overlook changes in system header files or external commands (such as compilers) if you don\*(Aqt specify those dependecies explicitly\&. This is the default behavior\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-config=force
.RS 4
If this option is specified, all configuration tests will be re\-run regardless of whether the cached results are out of date\&. This can be used to explicitly force the configuration tests to be updated in response to an otherwise unconfigured change in a system header file or compiler\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-config=cache
.RS 4
If this option is specified, no configuration tests will be rerun and all results will be taken from cache\&. Note that scons will still consider it an error if \-\-config=cache is specified and a necessary test does not yet have any results in the cache\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C\fI directory\fR, \-\-directory=\fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Change to the specified
\fIdirectory\fR
before searching for the
\fISConstruct\fR,
\fISconstruct\fR, or
\fIsconstruct\fR
file, or doing anything else\&. Multiple
\fB\-C\fR
options are interpreted relative to the previous one, and the right\-most
\fB\-C\fR
option wins\&. (This option is nearly equivalent to
\fB\-f directory/SConstruct\fR, except that it will search for
\fISConstruct\fR,
\fISconstruct\fR, or
\fIsconstruct\fR
in the specified directory\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-D
.RS 4
Works exactly the same way as the
\fB\-u\fR
option except for the way default targets are handled\&. When this option is used and no targets are specified on the command line, all default targets are built, whether or not they are below the current directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=\fItype\fR
.RS 4
Debug the build process\&.
\fItype[,type\&.\&.\&.]\fR
specifies what type of debugging\&. Multiple types may be specified, separated by commas\&. The following types are valid:
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=count
.RS 4
Print how many objects are created of the various classes used internally by SCons before and after reading the SConscript files and before and after building targets\&. This is not supported when SCons is executed with the Python
\fB\-O\fR
(optimized) option or when the SCons modules have been compiled with optimization (that is, when executing from
\fB*\&.pyo\fR
files)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=duplicate
.RS 4
Print a line for each unlink/relink (or copy) of a variant file from its source file\&. Includes debugging info for unlinking stale variant files, as well as unlinking old targets before building them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=dtree
.RS 4
A synonym for the newer
\fB\-\-tree=derived\fR
option\&. This will be deprecated in some future release and ultimately removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=explain
.RS 4
Print an explanation of precisely why
\fBscons\fR
is deciding to (re\-)build any targets\&. (Note: this does not print anything for targets that are
\fInot\fR
rebuilt\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=findlibs
.RS 4
Instruct the scanner that searches for libraries to print a message about each potential library name it is searching for, and about the actual libraries it finds\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=includes
.RS 4
Print the include tree after each top\-level target is built\&. This is generally used to find out what files are included by the sources of a given derived file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ scons \-\-debug=includes foo\&.o
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=memoizer
.RS 4
Prints a summary of hits and misses using the Memoizer, an internal subsystem that counts how often SCons uses cached values in memory instead of recomputing them each time they\*(Aqre needed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=memory
.RS 4
Prints how much memory SCons uses before and after reading the SConscript files and before and after building targets\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=nomemoizer
.RS 4
A deprecated option preserved for backwards compatibility\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=objects
.RS 4
Prints a list of the various objects of the various classes used internally by SCons\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=pdb
.RS 4
Re\-run SCons under the control of the pdb Python debugger\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=prepare
.RS 4
Print a line each time any target (internal or external) is prepared for building\&.
\fBscons\fR
prints this for each target it considers, even if that target is up to date (see also \-\-debug=explain)\&. This can help debug problems with targets that aren\*(Aqt being built; it shows whether
\fBscons\fR
is at least considering them or not\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=presub
.RS 4
Print the raw command line used to build each target before the construction environment variables are substituted\&. Also shows which targets are being built by this command\&. Output looks something like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ scons \-\-debug=presub
Building myprog\&.o with action(s):
  $SHCC $SHCFLAGS $SHCCFLAGS $CPPFLAGS $_CPPINCFLAGS \-c \-o $TARGET $SOURCES
\&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=stacktrace
.RS 4
Prints an internal Python stack trace when encountering an otherwise unexplained error\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=stree
.RS 4
A synonym for the newer
\fB\-\-tree=all,status\fR
option\&. This will be deprecated in some future release and ultimately removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=time
.RS 4
Prints various time profiling information: the time spent executing each individual build command; the total build time (time SCons ran from beginning to end); the total time spent reading and executing SConscript files; the total time spent SCons itself spend running (that is, not counting reading and executing SConscript files); and both the total time spent executing all build commands and the elapsed wall\-clock time spent executing those build commands\&. (When
\fBscons\fR
is executed without the
\fB\-j\fR
option, the elapsed wall\-clock time will typically be slightly longer than the total time spent executing all the build commands, due to the SCons processing that takes place in between executing each command\&. When
\fBscons\fR
is executed
\fIwith\fR
the
\fB\-j\fR
option, and your build configuration allows good parallelization, the elapsed wall\-clock time should be significantly smaller than the total time spent executing all the build commands, since multiple build commands and intervening SCons processing should take place in parallel\&.)
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug=tree
.RS 4
A synonym for the newer
\fB\-\-tree=all\fR
option\&. This will be deprecated in some future release and ultimately removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-diskcheck=\fItypes\fR
.RS 4
Enable specific checks for whether or not there is a file on disk where the SCons configuration expects a directory (or vice versa), and whether or not RCS or SCCS sources exist when searching for source and include files\&. The
\fItypes\fR
argument can be set to:
\fBall\fR, to enable all checks explicitly (the default behavior);
\fBnone\fR, to disable all such checks;
\fBmatch\fR, to check that files and directories on disk match SCons\*(Aq expected configuration;
\fBrcs\fR, to check for the existence of an RCS source for any missing source or include files;
\fBsccs\fR, to check for the existence of an SCCS source for any missing source or include files\&. Multiple checks can be specified separated by commas; for example,
\fB\-\-diskcheck=sccs,rcs\fR
would still check for SCCS and RCS sources, but disable the check for on\-disk matches of files and directories\&. Disabling some or all of these checks can provide a performance boost for large configurations, or when the configuration will check for files and/or directories across networked or shared file systems, at the slight increased risk of an incorrect build or of not handling errors gracefully (if include files really should be found in SCCS or RCS, for example, or if a file really does exist where the SCons configuration expects a directory)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-duplicate=\fIORDER\fR
.RS 4
There are three ways to duplicate files in a build tree: hard links, soft (symbolic) links and copies\&. The default behaviour of SCons is to prefer hard links to soft links to copies\&. You can specify different behaviours with this option\&.
\fIORDER\fR
must be one of
\fIhard\-soft\-copy\fR
(the default),
\fIsoft\-hard\-copy\fR,
\fIhard\-copy\fR,
\fIsoft\-copy\fR
or
\fIcopy\fR\&. SCons will attempt to duplicate files using the mechanisms in the specified order\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f\fI file\fR, \-\-file=\fIfile\fR, \-\-makefile=\fIfile\fR, \-\-sconstruct=\fIfile\fR
.RS 4
Use
\fIfile\fR
as the initial SConscript file\&. Multiple
\fB\-f\fR
options may be specified, in which case
\fBscons\fR
will read all of the specified files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-h, \-\-help
.RS 4
Print a local help message for this build, if one is defined in the SConscript file(s), plus a line that describes the
\fB\-H\fR
option for command\-line option help\&. If no local help message is defined, prints the standard help message about command\-line options\&. Exits after displaying the appropriate message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-H, \-\-help\-options
.RS 4
Print the standard help message about command\-line options and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-ignore\-errors
.RS 4
Ignore all errors from commands executed to rebuild files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-I\fI directory\fR, \-\-include\-dir=\fIdirectory\fR
.RS 4
Specifies a
\fIdirectory\fR
to search for imported Python modules\&. If several
\fB\-I\fR
options are used, the directories are searched in the order specified\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-implicit\-cache
.RS 4
Cache implicit dependencies\&. This causes
\fBscons\fR
to use the implicit (scanned) dependencies from the last time it was run instead of scanning the files for implicit dependencies\&. This can significantly speed up SCons, but with the following limitations:
.RE
.PP
\fBscons\fR
will not detect changes to implicit dependency search paths (e\&.g\&.
\fBCPPPATH\fR,
\fBLIBPATH\fR) that would ordinarily cause different versions of same\-named files to be used\&.
.PP
\fBscons\fR
will miss changes in the implicit dependencies in cases where a new implicit dependency is added earlier in the implicit dependency search path (e\&.g\&.
\fBCPPPATH\fR,
\fBLIBPATH\fR) than a current implicit dependency with the same name\&.
.PP
\-\-implicit\-deps\-changed
.RS 4
Forces SCons to ignore the cached implicit dependencies\&. This causes the implicit dependencies to be rescanned and recached\&. This implies
\fB\-\-implicit\-cache\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-implicit\-deps\-unchanged
.RS 4
Force SCons to ignore changes in the implicit dependencies\&. This causes cached implicit dependencies to always be used\&. This implies
\fB\-\-implicit\-cache\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-interactive
.RS 4
Starts SCons in interactive mode\&. The SConscript files are read once and a
\fBscons>>>\fR
prompt is printed\&. Targets may now be rebuilt by typing commands at interactive prompt without having to re\-read the SConscript files and re\-initialize the dependency graph from scratch\&.
.sp
SCons interactive mode supports the following commands:
.PP
\fBbuild\fR\fI[OPTIONS] [TARGETS] \&.\&.\&.\fR
.RS 4
Builds the specified
\fITARGETS\fR
(and their dependencies) with the specified SCons command\-line
\fIOPTIONS\fR\&.
\fBb\fR
and
\fBscons\fR
are synonyms\&.
.sp

A construction environment is the basic means by which the SConscript files communicate build information to

\fBEnvironment\fR
function:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Variables, called
\fIconstruction\fR
\fIvariables\fR, may be set in a construction environment either by specifying them as keywords when the object is created or by assigning them a value after the object is created:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
env = Environment(FOO = \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)
env[\*(AqBAR\*(Aq] = \*(Aqbar\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\

.PP
As a convenience, construction variables may also be set or modified by the
\fIparse_flags\fR
keyword argument, which applies the
\fBParseFlags\fR
method (described below) to the argument value after all other processing is completed\&. This is useful either if the exact content of the flags is unknown (for example, read from a control file) or if the flags are distributed to a number of construction variables\&.

\fBLIBS\fR\&.
.PP
By default, a new construction environment is initialized with a set of builder methods and construction variables that are appropriate for the current platform\&. An optional platform keyword argument may be used to specify that an environment should be initialized for a different platform:
.sp
.if n \{\

.if n \{\
.RE

.PP
Specifying a platform initializes the appropriate construction variables in the environment to use and generate file names with prefixes and suffixes appropriate for the platform\&.
.PP
Note that the
\fBwin32\fR
platform adds the
\fBSystemDrive\fR
and
\fBSystemRoot\fR
variables from the user\*(Aqs external environment to the construction environment\*(Aqs
\fBENV\fR
dictionary\&. This is so that any executed commands that use sockets to connect with other systems (such as fetching source files from external CVS repository specifications like
\fB:pserver:anonymous@cvs\&.sourceforge\&.net:/cvsroot/scons\fR) will work on Windows systems\&.
.PP
The platform argument may be function or callable object, in which case the Environment() method will call the specified argument to update the new construction environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
def my_platform(env):
    env[\*(AqVAR\*(Aq] = \*(Aqxyzzy\*(Aq

env = Environment(platform = my_platform)

Additionally, a specific set of tools with which to initialize the environment may be specified as an optional keyword argument:

.fi
.if n \{\

.PP
This looks for a tool specification in tools/foo\&.py (as well as using the ordinary default tools for the platform)\&. foo\&.py should have two functions: generate(env, **kw) and exists(env)\&. The
\fBgenerate()\fR
function modifies the passed\-in environment to set up variables so that the tool can be executed; it may use any keyword arguments that the user supplies (see below) to vary its initialization\&. The
\fBexists()\fR
function should return a true value if the tool is available\&. Tools in the toolpath are used before any of the built\-in ones\&. For example, adding gcc\&.py to the toolpath would override the built\-in gcc tool\&. Also note that the toolpath is stored in the environment for use by later calls to
\fBClone\fR() and
\fBTool\fR() methods:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
base = Environment(toolpath=[\*(Aqcustom_path\*(Aq])
derived = base\&.Clone(tools=[\*(Aqcustom_tool\*(Aq])
derived\&.CustomBuilder()
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The elements of the tools list may also be functions or callable objects, in which case the Environment() method will call the specified elements to update the new construction environment:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
def my_tool(env):
    env[\*(AqXYZZY\*(Aq] = \*(Aqxyzzy\*(Aq

env = Environment(tools = [my_tool])
.fi
.if n \{\

.PP
The individual elements of the tools list may also themselves be two\-element lists of the form (\fItoolname\fR,
\fIkw_dict\fR)\&. SCons searches for the
\fItoolname\fR
specification file as described above, and passes
\fIkw_dict\fR, which must be a dictionary, as keyword arguments to the tool\*(Aqs
\fBgenerate\fR
function\&. The
\fBgenerate\fR
function can use the arguments to modify the tool\*(Aqs behavior by setting up the environment in different ways or otherwise changing its initialization\&.

docbook
.RS 4
This tool tries to make working with Docbook in SCons a little easier\&. It provides several toolchains for creating different output formats, like HTML or PDF\&. Contained in the package is a distribution of the Docbook XSL stylesheets as of version 1\&.76\&.1\&. As long as you don\*(Aqt specify your own stylesheets for customization, these official versions are picked as default\&.\&.\&.which should reduce the inevitable setup hassles for you\&.
.sp
Implicit dependencies to images and XIncludes are detected automatically if you meet the HTML requirements\&. The additional stylesheet
utils/xmldepend\&.xsl
by Paul DuBois is used for this purpose\&.
.sp
Note, that there is no support for XML catalog resolving offered! This tool calls the XSLT processors and PDF renderers with the stylesheets you specified, that\*(Aqs it\&. The rest lies in your hands and you still have to know what you\*(Aqre doing when resolving names via a catalog\&.
.sp
For activating the tool "docbook", you have to add its name to the Environment constructor, like this
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
On its startup, the Docbook tool tries to find a required
xsltproc
processor, and a PDF renderer, e\&.g\&.
fop\&. So make sure that these are added to your system\*(Aqs environment
PATH
and can be called directly, without specifying their full path\&.
.sp
For the most basic processing of Docbook to HTML, you need to have installed
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1

.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
to get both outputs from your XML source
manual\&.xml\&. As a shortcut, you can give the stem of the filenames alone, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\

env\&.DocbookHtml(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)
env\&.DocbookPdf(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)

.if n \{\

and get the same result\&. Target and source lists are also supported:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtml([\*(Aqmanual\&.html\*(Aq,\*(Aqreference\&.html\*(Aq], [\*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq,\*(Aqreference\&.xml\*(Aq])

Whenever you leave out the list of sources, you may not specify a file extension! The Tool uses the given names as file stems, and adds the suffixes for target and source files accordingly\&.

The rules given above are valid for the Builders
\fBDocbookHtml\fR,
\fBDocbookPdf\fR,
\fBDocbookEpub\fR,
\fBDocbookSlidesPdf\fR
and
\fBDocbookXInclude\fR\&. For the
\fBDocbookMan\fR
transformation you can specify a target name, but the actual output names are automatically set from the
refname
entries in your XML source\&.
.sp
The Builders
\fBDocbookHtmlChunked\fR,
\fBDocbookHtmlhelp\fR
and
\fBDocbookSlidesHtml\fR
are special, in that:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

they create a large set of files, where the exact names and their number depend on the content of the source file, and
.RE

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c

.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
the main target is always named
index\&.html, i\&.e\&. the output name for the XSL transformation is not picked up by the stylesheets\&.
.RE
.sp
As a result, there is simply no use in specifying a target HTML name\&. So the basic syntax for these builders is always:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(tools=[\*(Aqdocbook\*(Aq])
env\&.DocbookHtmlhelp(\*(Aqmanual\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If you want to use a specific XSL file, you can set the additional
xsl
parameter to your Builder call as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.DocbookHtml(\*(Aqother\&.html\*(Aq, \*(Aqmanual\&.xml\*(Aq, xsl=\*(Aqhtml\&.xsl\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Since this may get tedious if you always use the same local naming for your customized XSL files, e\&.g\&.
html\&.xsl
for HTML and
pdf\&.xsl
for PDF output, a set of variables for setting the default XSL name is provided\&. These are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTML        
DOCBOOK_DEFAULT_XSL_HTMLCHUNKED

Additionally, there is a "tool" named

which configures the environment with a default set of tools for the current platform\&.
.PP
On posix and cygwin platforms the GNU tools (e\&.g\&. gcc) are preferred by SCons, on Windows the Microsoft tools (e\&.g\&. msvc) followed by MinGW are preferred by SCons, and in OS/2 the IBM tools (e\&.g\&. icc) are preferred by SCons\&.
.SS "Builder Methods"
.PP
Build rules are specified by calling a construction environment\*(Aqs builder methods\&. The arguments to the builder methods are
\fBtarget\fR
(a list of targets to be built, usually file names) and
\fBsource\fR
(a list of sources to be built, usually file names)\&.
.PP
Because long lists of file names can lead to a lot of quoting,
\fBscons\fR
supplies a
\fBSplit()\fR
global function and a same\-named environment method that split a single string into a list, separated on strings of white\-space characters\&. (These are similar to the split() member function of Python strings but work even if the input isn\*(Aqt a string\&.)
.PP
Like all Python arguments, the target and source arguments to a builder method can be specified either with or without the "target" and "source" keywords\&. When the keywords are omitted, the target is first, followed by the source\&. The following are equivalent examples of calling the Program builder method:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, [\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq])
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, env\&.Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(source =  [\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq], target = \*(Aqbar\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(target = \*(Aqbar\*(Aq, Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(target = \*(Aqbar\*(Aq, env\&.Split(\*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq))
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source = \*(Aqbar\&.c foo\&.c\*(Aq\&.split())
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Target and source file names that are not absolute path names (that is, do not begin with
\fB/\fR
on POSIX systems or
\fB\efR on Windows systems, with or without an optional drive letter) are interpreted relative to the directory containing the SConscript\fR
file being read\&. An initial
\fB#\fR
(hash mark) on a path name means that the rest of the file name is interpreted relative to the directory containing the top\-level
\fBSConstruct\fR
file, even if the
\fB#\fR
is followed by a directory separator character (slash or backslash)\&.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# The comments describing the targets that will be built
# assume these calls are in a SConscript file in the
# a subdirectory named "subdir"\&.

# Builds the program "subdir/foo" from "subdir/foo\&.c":

# Builds the program "/tmp/bar" from "subdir/bar\&.c":
env\&.Program(\*(Aq/tmp/bar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# An initial \*(Aq#\*(Aq or \*(Aq#/\*(Aq are equivalent; the following
# calls build the programs "foo" and "bar" (in the
# top\-level SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo\&.c" and
# "subdir/bar\&.c", respectively:
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#foo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#/bar\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)

# Builds the program "other/foo" (relative to the top\-level
# SConstruct directory) from "subdir/foo\&.c":
env\&.Program(\*(Aq#other/foo\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
When the target shares the same base name as the source and only the suffix varies, and if the builder method has a suffix defined for the target file type, then the target argument may be omitted completely, and
\fBscons\fR
will deduce the target file name from the source file name\&. The following examples all build the executable program
\fBbar\fR
(on POSIX systems) or
\fBbar\&.exe\fR
(on Windows systems) from the bar\&.c source file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(target = \*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source = \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\*(Aq, source = \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(source = \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
As a convenience, a
\fBsrcdir\fR
keyword argument may be specified when calling a Builder\&. When specified, all source file strings that are not absolute paths will be interpreted relative to the specified
\fBsrcdir\fR\&. The following example will build the
\fBbuild/prog\fR
(or
\fBbuild/prog\&.exe\fR
on Windows) program from the files
\fBsrc/f1\&.c\fR
and
\fBsrc/f2\&.c\fR:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqbuild/prog\*(Aq, [\*(Aqf1\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqf2\&.c\*(Aq], srcdir=\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
It is possible to override or add construction variables when calling a builder method by passing additional keyword arguments\&. These overridden or added variables will only be in effect when building the target, so they will not affect other parts of the build\&. For example, if you want to add additional libraries for just one program:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq, LIBS=[\*(Aqgl\*(Aq, \*(Aqglut\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or generate a shared library with a non\-standard suffix:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.SharedLibrary(\*(Aqword\*(Aq, \*(Aqword\&.cpp\*(Aq,
                  SHLIBSUFFIX=\*(Aq\&.ocx\*(Aq,
                  LIBSUFFIXES=[\*(Aq\&.ocx\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
(Note that both the $SHLIBSUFFIX and $LIBSUFFIXES variables must be set if you want SCons to search automatically for dependencies on the non\-standard library names; see the descriptions of these variables, below, for more information\&.)
.PP
It is also possible to use the
\fIparse_flags\fR
keyword argument in an override:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq, parse_flags = \*(Aq\-Iinclude \-DEBUG \-lm\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
This example adds \*(Aqinclude\*(Aq to
\fBCPPPATH\fR, \*(AqEBUG\*(Aq to
\fBCPPDEFINES\fR, and \*(Aqm\*(Aq to
\fBLIBS\fR\&.
.PP
Although the builder methods defined by
\fBscons\fR
are, in fact, methods of a construction environment object, they may also be called without an explicit environment:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Program(\*(Aqhello\*(Aq, \*(Aqhello\&.c\*(Aq)
SharedLibrary(\*(Aqword\*(Aq, \*(Aqword\&.cpp\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In this case, the methods are called internally using a default construction environment that consists of the tools and values that
\fBscons\fR
has determined are appropriate for the local system\&.
.PP
Builder methods that can be called without an explicit environment may be called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript file by adding the following to the Python module:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
from SCons\&.Script import *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
All builder methods return a list\-like object containing Nodes that represent the target or targets that will be built\&. A
\fINode\fR
is an internal SCons object which represents build targets or sources\&.
.PP
The returned Node\-list object can be passed to other builder methods as source(s) or passed to any SCons function or method where a filename would normally be accepted\&. For example, if it were necessary to add a specific
\fB\-D\fR
flag when compiling one specific object file:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bar_obj_list = env\&.StaticObject(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, CPPDEFINES=\*(Aq\-DBAR\*(Aq)
env\&.Program(source = [\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq, bar_obj_list, \*(Aqmain\&.c\*(Aq])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Using a Node in this way makes for a more portable build by avoiding having to specify a platform\-specific object suffix when calling the Program() builder method\&.
.PP
Note that Builder calls will automatically "flatten" the source and target file lists, so it\*(Aqs all right to have the bar_obj list return by the StaticObject() call in the middle of the source file list\&. If you need to manipulate a list of lists returned by Builders directly using Python, you can either build the list by hand:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = Object(\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
bar = Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
objects = [\*(Aqbegin\&.o\*(Aq] + foo + [\*(Aqmiddle\&.o\*(Aq] + bar + [\*(Aqend\&.o\*(Aq]
for object in objects:
    print str(object)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Or you can use the
\fBFlatten\fR() function supplied by scons to create a list containing just the Nodes, which may be more convenient:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = Object(\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq)
bar = Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
objects = Flatten([\*(Aqbegin\&.o\*(Aq, foo, \*(Aqmiddle\&.o\*(Aq, bar, \*(Aqend\&.o\*(Aq])
for object in objects:
    print str(object)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note also that because Builder calls return a list\-like object, not an actual Python list, you should
\fInot\fR
use the Python
\fB+=\fR
operator to append Builder results to a Python list\&. Because the list and the object are different types, Python will not update the original list in place, but will instead create a new Node\-list object containing the concatenation of the list elements and the Builder results\&. This will cause problems for any other Python variables in your SCons configuration that still hold on to a reference to the original list\&. Instead, use the Python
\fB\&.extend()\fR
method to make sure the list is updated in\-place\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
object_files = []

# Do NOT use += as follows:
#
#    object_files += Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq)
#
# It will not update the object_files list in place\&.
#
# Instead, use the \&.extend() method:
object_files\&.extend(Object(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq))

.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The path name for a Node\*(Aqs file may be used by passing the Node to the Python\-builtin
\fBstr()\fR
function:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bar_obj_list = env\&.StaticObject(\*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq, CPPDEFINES=\*(Aq\-DBAR\*(Aq)
print "The path to bar_obj is:", str(bar_obj_list[0])
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note again that because the Builder call returns a list, we have to access the first element in the list
\fB(bar_obj_list[0])\fR
to get at the Node that actually represents the object file\&.
.PP
Builder calls support a
\fBchdir\fR
keyword argument that specifies that the Builder\*(Aqs action(s) should be executed after changing directory\&. If the
\fBchdir\fR
argument is a string or a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory\&. If the
\fBchdir\fR
is not a string or Node and is non\-zero, then scons will change to the target file\*(Aqs directory\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
# scons will change to the "sub" subdirectory
# before executing the "cp" command\&.
env\&.Command(\*(Aqsub/dir/foo\&.out\*(Aq, \*(Aqsub/dir/foo\&.in\*(Aq,
            "cp dir/foo\&.in dir/foo\&.out",
            chdir=\*(Aqsub\*(Aq)

# Because chdir is not a string, scons will change to the
# target\*(Aqs directory ("sub/dir") before executing the
# "cp" command\&.
env\&.Command(\*(Aqsub/dir/foo\&.out\*(Aq, \*(Aqsub/dir/foo\&.in\*(Aq,
            "cp foo\&.in foo\&.out",
            chdir=1)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that scons will
\fInot\fR
automatically modify its expansion of construction variables like
\fB$TARGET\fR
and
\fB$SOURCE\fR
when using the chdir keyword argument\-\-that is, the expanded file names will still be relative to the top\-level SConstruct directory, and consequently incorrect relative to the chdir directory\&. If you use the chdir keyword argument, you will typically need to supply a different command line using expansions like
\fB${TARGET\&.file}\fR
and
\fB${SOURCE\&.file}\fR
to use just the filename portion of the targets and source\&.

Builds a Microsoft Visual Studio project file, and by default builds a solution file as well\&.
.sp
This builds a Visual Studio project file, based on the version of Visual Studio that is configured (either the latest installed version, or the version specified by
\fB$MSVS_VERSION\fR
in the Environment constructor)\&. For Visual Studio 6, it will generate a
\&.dsp
file\&. For Visual Studio 7 (\&.NET) and later versions, it will generate a

.sp
By default, this also generates a solution file for the specified project, a
\&.dsw
file for Visual Studio 6 or a
\&.sln
file for Visual Studio 7 (\&.NET)\&. This behavior may be disabled by specifying
auto_build_solution=0

\fBMSVSSolution\fR

.sp
The
\fBMSVSProject\fR
builder takes several lists of filenames to be placed into the project file\&. These are currently limited to
srcs,
incs,
localincs,
resources, and
misc\&. These are pretty self\-explanatory, but it should be noted that these lists are added to the
\fB$SOURCES\fR
construction variable as strings, NOT as SCons File Nodes\&. This is because they represent file names to be added to the project file, not the source files used to build the project file\&.
.sp
The above filename lists are all optional, although at least one must be specified for the resulting project file to be non\-empty\&.
.sp
In addition to the above lists of values, the following values may be specified:
.PP
target
.RS 4
The name of the target
\&.dsp

\&.vcproj
file\&. The correct suffix for the version of Visual Studio must be used, but the
\fB$MSVSPROJECTSUFFIX\fR
construction variable will be defined to the correct value (see example below)\&.
.RE
.PP
variant
.RS 4
The name of this particular variant\&. For Visual Studio 7 projects, this can also be a list of variant names\&. These are typically things like "Debug" or "Release", but really can be anything you want\&. For Visual Studio 7 projects, they may also specify a target platform separated from the variant name by a
|
(vertical pipe) character:
Debug|Xbox\&. The default target platform is Win32\&. Multiple calls to
\fBMSVSProject\fR

.RE
.PP
cmdargs
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
buildtarget
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
runfile
.RS 4
The name of the file that Visual Studio 7 and later will run and debug\&. This appears as the value of the

buildtarget
value\&.
.RE
.sp
Note that because
SCons
always executes its build commands from the directory in which the
SConstruct
file is located, if you generate a project file in a different directory than the

/FC

The last approach is perhaps the recommended one\&. It allows easily split internationalization/localization onto separate SCons scripts, where a script in source tree is responsible for translations (from sources to
PO
files) and script(s) under variant directories are responsible for compilation of
PO
to
MO
files to and for installation of
MO
files\&. The "gluing factor" synchronizing these two scripts is then the content of
LINGUAS
file\&. Note, that the updated
POT
and
PO
files are usually going to be committed back to the repository, so they must be updated within the source directory (and not in variant directories)\&. Additionaly, the file listing of
po/
directory contains
LINGUAS
file, so the source tree looks familiar to translators, and they may work with the project in their usual way\&.

All targets of builder methods automatically depend on their sources\&. An explicit dependency can be specified using the

In addition,

.SS "Methods and Functions to Do Things"
.PP
In addition to Builder methods,
\fBscons\fR
provides a number of other construction environment methods and global functions to manipulate the build configuration\&.
.PP
Usually, a construction environment method and global function with the same name both exist so that you don\*(Aqt have to remember whether to a specific bit of functionality must be called with or without a construction environment\&. In the following list, if you call something as a global function it looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Function(\fIarguments\fR)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
and if you call something through a construction environment it looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env\&.Function(\fIarguments\fR)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If you can call the functionality in both ways, then both forms are listed\&.
.PP
Global functions may be called from custom Python modules that you import into an SConscript file by adding the following to the Python module:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
from SCons\&.Script import *
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Except where otherwise noted, the same\-named construction environment method and global function provide the exact same functionality\&. The only difference is that, where appropriate, calling the functionality through a construction environment will substitute construction variables into any supplied strings\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env = Environment(FOO = \*(Aqfoo\*(Aq)
Default(\*(Aq$FOO\*(Aq)
env\&.Default(\*(Aq$FOO\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
In the above example, the first call to the global
\fBDefault()\fR
function will actually add a target named
\fB$FOO\fR
to the list of default targets, while the second call to the
\fBenv\&.Default()\fR
construction environment method will expand the value and add a target named
\fBfoo\fR
to the list of default targets\&. For more on construction variable expansion, see the next section on construction variables\&.
.PP
Construction environment methods and global functions supported by
\fBscons\fR
include:
.PP
Action(action, [cmd/str/fun, [var, \&.\&.\&.]] [option=value, \&.\&.\&.]), env\&.Action(action, [cmd/str/fun, [var, \&.\&.\&.]] [option=value, \&.\&.\&.])
.RS 4
Creates an Action object for the specified
\fIaction\fR\&. See the section "Action Objects," below, for a complete explanation of the arguments and behavior\&.
.sp
Note that the
\fBenv\&.Action\fR() form of the invocation will expand construction variables in any argument strings, including the
\fIaction\fR
argument, at the time it is called using the construction variables in the
\fIenv\fR
construction environment through which
\fBenv\&.Action\fR() was called\&. The

AddOption(arguments)

This function adds a new command\-line option to be recognized\&. The specified

\fBoptparse\&.add_option\fR() method (with a few additional capabilities noted below); see the documentation for
optparse
for a thorough discussion of its option\-processing capabities\&.
.sp
In addition to the arguments and values supported by the
\fBoptparse\&.add_option\fR() method, the SCons
\fBAddOption\fR
function allows you to set the
nargs
keyword value to
\*(Aq?\*(Aq
(a string with just the question mark) to indicate that the specified long option(s) take(s) an
\fIoptional\fR
argument\&. When
nargs = \*(Aq?\*(Aq
is passed to the
\fBAddOption\fR
function, the
const
keyword argument may be used to supply the "default" value that should be used when the option is specified on the command line without an explicit argument\&.
.sp
If no
default=
keyword argument is supplied when calling
\fBAddOption\fR, the option will have a default value of
None\&.
.sp
Once a new command\-line option has been added with
\fBAddOption\fR, the option value may be accessed using
\fBGetOption\fR
or
\fBenv\&.GetOption\fR()\&. The value may also be set, using
\fBSetOption\fR
or
\fBenv\&.SetOption\fR(), if conditions in a
SConscript
require overriding any default value\&. Note, however, that a value specified on the command line will
\fIalways\fR
override a value set by any SConscript file\&.
.sp
Any specified
help=
strings for the new option(s) will be displayed by the
\fB\-H\fR
or
\fB\-h\fR
options (the latter only if no other help text is specified in the SConscript files)\&. The help text for the local options specified by
\fBAddOption\fR

Command(target, source, action, [key=val, \&.\&.\&.]), env\&.Command(target, source, action, [key=val, \&.\&.\&.])
.RS 4
Executes a specific action (or list of actions) to build a target file or files\&. This is more convenient than defining a separate Builder object for a single special\-case build\&.
.sp
As a special case, the
\fIsource_scanner\fR
keyword argument can be used to specify a Scanner object that will be used to scan the sources\&. (The global
DirScanner

.sp
Any other keyword arguments specified override any same\-named existing construction variables\&.
.sp
An action can be an external command, specified as a string, or a callable Python object; see "Action Objects," below, for more complete information\&. Also note that a string specifying an external command may be preceded by an
@

.PP
timestamp\-newer

.RE

GetBuildFailures()
.RS 4
Returns a list of exceptions for the actions that failed while attempting to build targets\&. Each element in the returned list is a
BuildError
object with the following attributes that record various aspects of the build failure:
.sp

\&.node
The node that was being built when the build failure occurred\&.
.sp

\&.status
The numeric exit status returned by the command or Python function that failed when trying to build the specified Node\&.
.sp

\&.errstr
The SCons error string describing the build failure\&. (This is often a generic message like "Error 2" to indicate that an executed command exited with a status of 2\&.)
.sp

\&.filename
The name of the file or directory that actually caused the failure\&. This may be different from the
\&.node
attribute\&. For example, if an attempt to build a target named
sub/dir/target
fails because the
sub/dir
directory could not be created, then the
\&.node
attribute will be
sub/dir/target
but the
\&.filename
attribute will be
sub/dir\&.
.sp

\&.executor
The SCons Executor object for the target Node being built\&. This can be used to retrieve the construction environment used for the failed action\&.
.sp

\&.action
The actual SCons Action object that failed\&. This will be one specific action out of the possible list of actions that would have been executed to build the target\&.
.sp

\&.command
The actual expanded command that was executed and failed, after expansion of
\fB$TARGET\fR,
\fB$SOURCE\fR, and other construction variables\&.
.sp
Note that the
\fBGetBuildFailures\fR
function will always return an empty list until any build failure has occurred, which means that
\fBGetBuildFailures\fR
will always return an empty list while the
SConscript
files are being read\&. Its primary intended use is for functions that will be executed before SCons exits by passing them to the standard Python
\fBatexit\&.register\fR() function\&. Example:

Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude]), env\&.Glob(pattern, [ondisk, source, strings, exclude])
.RS 4
Returns Nodes (or strings) that match the specified
\fIpattern\fR, relative to the directory of the current
SConscript
file\&. The
\fBenv\&.Glob\fR() form performs string substition on
\fIpattern\fR
and returns whatever matches the resulting expanded pattern\&.
.sp
The specified
\fIpattern\fR
uses Unix shell style metacharacters for matching:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
  *       matches everything
  ?       matches any single character
  [seq]   matches any character in seq
  [!seq]  matches any char not in seq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the first character of a filename is a dot, it must be matched explicitly\&. Character matches do
\fInot\fR
span directory separators\&.
.sp
The
\fBGlob\fR
knows about repositories (see the
\fBRepository\fR
function) and source directories (see the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function) and returns a Node (or string, if so configured) in the local (SConscript) directory if matching Node is found anywhere in a corresponding repository or source directory\&.
.sp
The
\fIondisk\fR
argument may be set to
False
(or any other non\-true value) to disable the search for matches on disk, thereby only returning matches among already\-configured File or Dir Nodes\&. The default behavior is to return corresponding Nodes for any on\-disk matches found\&.
.sp
The
\fIsource\fR
argument may be set to
True
(or any equivalent value) to specify that, when the local directory is a
\fBVariantDir\fR, the returned Nodes should be from the corresponding source directory, not the local directory\&.
.sp
The
\fIstrings\fR
argument may be set to
True
(or any equivalent value) to have the
\fBGlob\fR
function return strings, not Nodes, that represent the matched files or directories\&. The returned strings will be relative to the local (SConscript) directory\&. (Note that This may make it easier to perform arbitrary manipulation of file names, but if the returned strings are passed to a different
SConscript
file, any Node translation will be relative to the other
SConscript
directory, not the original
SConscript
directory\&.)
.sp
The
\fIexclude\fR
argument may be set to a pattern or a list of patterns (following the same Unix shell semantics) which must be filtered out of returned elements\&. Elements matching a least one pattern of this list will be excluded\&.

Ignore(target, dependency), env\&.Ignore(target, dependency)
.RS 4
The specified dependency file(s) will be ignored when deciding if the target file(s) need to be rebuilt\&.
.sp
You can also use
\fBIgnore\fR
to remove a target from the default build\&. In order to do this you must specify the directory the target will be built in as the target, and the file you want to skip building as the dependency\&.

env\&.MergeFlags(arg, [unique])
.RS 4
Merges the specified
\fIarg\fR
values to the construction environment\*(Aqs construction variables\&. If the
\fIarg\fR
argument is not a dictionary, it is converted to one by calling
\fBenv\&.ParseFlags\fR
on the argument before the values are merged\&. Note that
\fIarg\fR
must be a single value, so multiple strings must be passed in as a list, not as separate arguments to
\fBenv\&.MergeFlags\fR\&.
.sp
By default, duplicate values are eliminated; you can, however, specify
unique=0
to allow duplicate values to be added\&. When eliminating duplicate values, any construction variables that end with the string

keep the left\-most unique value\&. All other construction variables keep the right\-most unique value\&.

Progress(callable, [interval]), Progress(string, [interval, file, overwrite]), Progress(list_of_strings, [interval, file, overwrite])
.RS 4
Allows SCons to show progress made during the build by displaying a string or calling a function while evaluating Nodes (e\&.g\&. files)\&.
.sp
If the first specified argument is a Python callable (a function or an object that has a
\fB__call__\fR() method), the function will be called once every
\fIinterval\fR
times a Node is evaluated\&. The callable will be passed the evaluated Node as its only argument\&. (For future compatibility, it\*(Aqs a good idea to also add
*args
and
**kw
as arguments to your function or method\&. This will prevent the code from breaking if SCons ever changes the interface to call the function with additional arguments in the future\&.)
.sp
An example of a simple custom progress function that prints a string containing the Node name every 10 Nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def my_progress_function(node, *args, **kw):
    print \*(AqEvaluating node %s!\*(Aq % node
Progress(my_progress_function, interval=10)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
A more complicated example of a custom progress display object that prints a string containing a count every 100 evaluated Nodes\&. Note the use of
\er
(a carriage return) at the end so that the string will overwrite itself on a display:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
class ProgressCounter(object):
    count = 0
    def __call__(self, node, *args, **kw):
        self\&.count += 100
        sys\&.stderr\&.write(\*(AqEvaluated %s nodes\er\*(Aq % self\&.count)
Progress(ProgressCounter(), interval=100)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the first argument
\fBProgress\fR
is a string, the string will be displayed every
\fIinterval\fR
evaluated Nodes\&. The default is to print the string on standard output; an alternate output stream may be specified with the
file=
argument\&. The following will print a series of dots on the error output, one dot for every 100 evaluated Nodes:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
Progress(\*(Aq\&.\*(Aq, interval=100, file=sys\&.stderr)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the string contains the verbatim substring
\fB$TARGET\fR, it will be replaced with the Node\&. Note that, for performance reasons, this is
\fInot\fR
a regular SCons variable substition, so you can not use other variables or use curly braces\&. The following example will print the name of every evaluated Node, using a
\er
(carriage return) to cause each line to overwritten by the next line, and the
overwrite=
keyword argument to make sure the previously\-printed file name is overwritten with blank spaces:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
import sys
Progress(\*(Aq$TARGET\er\*(Aq, overwrite=True)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the first argument to
\fBProgress\fR
is a list of strings, then each string in the list will be displayed in rotating fashion every
\fIinterval\fR
evaluated Nodes\&. This can be used to implement a "spinner" on the user\*(Aqs screen as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

To
scons, a repository is a copy of the source tree, from the top\-level directory on down, which may contain both source files and derived files that can be used to build targets in the local source tree\&. The canonical example would be an official source tree maintained by an integrator\&. If the repository contains derived files, then the derived files should have been built using
scons, so that the repository contains the necessary signature information to allow
scons
to figure out when it is appropriate to use the repository copy of a derived file, instead of building one locally\&.
.sp
Note that if an up\-to\-date derived file already exists in a repository,

.RS 4
This tells
scons
to execute one or more subsidiary SConscript (configuration) files\&. Any variables returned by a called script using
\fBReturn\fR
will be returned by the call to
\fBSConscript\fR\&. There are two ways to call the
\fBSConscript\fR
function\&.
.sp
The first way you can call
\fBSConscript\fR
is to explicitly specify one or more
\fIscripts\fR
as the first argument\&. A single script may be specified as a string; multiple scripts must be specified as a list (either explicitly or as created by a function like
\fBSplit\fR)\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(\*(AqSConscript\*(Aq)      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq)  # run SConscript in the src directory

config = SConscript(\*(AqMyConfig\&.py\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The second way you can call
\fBSConscript\fR
is to specify a list of (sub)directory names as a
dirs=\fIsubdirs\fR
keyword argument\&. In this case,
scons
will, by default, execute a subsidiary configuration file named
SConscript
in each of the specified directories\&. You may specify a name other than
SConscript
by supplying an optional
name=\fIscript\fR
keyword argument\&. The first three examples below have the same effect as the first three examples above:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aq\&.\*(Aq)      # run SConscript in the current directory
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq)    # run SConscript in the src directory
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqsrc\*(Aq, \*(Aqdoc\*(Aq])
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqsub1\*(Aq, \*(Aqsub2\*(Aq], name=\*(AqMySConscript\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The optional
\fIexports\fR
argument provides a list of variable names or a dictionary of named values to export to the
\fIscript(s)\fR\&. These variables are locally exported only to the specified
\fIscript(s)\fR, and do not affect the global pool of variables used by the
\fBExport\fR
function\&.
The subsidiary
\fIscript(s)\fR
must use the
\fBImport\fR
function to import the variables\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
foo = SConscript(\*(Aqsub/SConscript\*(Aq, exports=\*(Aqenv\*(Aq)
SConscript(\*(Aqdir/SConscript\*(Aq, exports=[\*(Aqenv\*(Aq, \*(Aqvariable\*(Aq])
SConscript(dirs=\*(Aqsubdir\*(Aq, exports=\*(Aqenv variable\*(Aq)
SConscript(dirs=[\*(Aqone\*(Aq, \*(Aqtwo\*(Aq, \*(Aqthree\*(Aq], exports=\*(Aqshared_info\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If the optional
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is present, it causes an effect equivalent to the
\fBVariantDir\fR
method described below\&. (If
\fIvariant_dir\fR
is not present, the

\fIduplicate\fR
argument is ignored\&.) The
\fIvariant_dir\fR
argument is interpreted relative to the directory of the calling
SConscript
file\&. See the description of the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function below for additional details and restrictions\&.
.sp
If
\fIvariant_dir\fR
is present,
the source directory is the directory in which the
SConscript
file resides and the
SConscript
file is evaluated as if it were in the
\fIvariant_dir\fR
directory:

.sp
The
\fBSourceSignatures\fR
function tells
scons
how to decide if a source file (a file that is not built from any other files) has changed since the last time it was used to build a particular target file\&. Legal values are
MD5
or
timestamp\&.
.sp
If the environment method is used, the specified type of source signature is only used when deciding whether targets built with that environment are up\-to\-date or must be rebuilt\&. If the global function is used, the specified type of source signature becomes the default used for all decisions about whether targets are up\-to\-date\&.

MD5
means
scons
decides that a source file has changed if the MD5 checksum of its contents has changed since the last time it was used to rebuild a particular target file\&.

timestamp

scons
decides that a source file has changed if its timestamp (modification time) has changed since the last time it was used to rebuild a particular target file\&. (Note that although this is similar to the behavior of Make, by default it will also rebuild if the dependency is

Returned string values or sequence elements are converted to their string representation by default\&. The optional

TargetSignatures(type), env\&.TargetSignatures(type)
.RS 4
Note: Although it is not yet officially deprecated, use of this function is discouraged\&. See the
\fBDecider\fR
function for a more flexible and straightforward way to configure SCons\*(Aq decision\-making\&.
.sp
The
\fBTargetSignatures\fR
function tells
scons
how to decide if a target file (a file that
\fIis\fR
built from any other files) has changed since the last time it was used to build some other target file\&. Legal values are
"build";
"content"
(or its synonym
"MD5");
"timestamp"; or
"source"\&.
.sp
If the environment method is used, the specified type of target signature is only used for targets built with that environment\&. If the global function is used, the specified type of signature becomes the default used for all target files that don\*(Aqt have an explicit target signature type specified for their environments\&.
.sp

"content"
(or its synonym
"MD5") means
scons
decides that a target file has changed if the MD5 checksum of its contents has changed since the last time it was used to rebuild some other target file\&. This means
scons
will open up MD5 sum the contents of target files after they\*(Aqre built, and may decide that it does not need to rebuild "downstream" target files if a file was rebuilt with exactly the same contents as the last time\&.
.sp

"timestamp"
means
scons
decides that a target file has changed if its timestamp (modification time) has changed since the last time it was used to rebuild some other target file\&. (Note that although this is similar to the behavior of Make, by default it will also rebuild if the dependency is
\fIolder\fR
than the last time it was used to rebuild the target file\&.)
.sp

"source"
means
scons
decides that a target file has changed as specified by the corresponding
\fBSourceSignatures\fR
setting ("MD5"
or
"timestamp")\&. This means that
scons
will treat all input files to a target the same way, regardless of whether they are source files or have been built from other files\&.
.sp

"build"
means
scons
decides that a target file has changed if it has been rebuilt in this invocation or if its content or timestamp have changed as specified by the corresponding
\fBSourceSignatures\fR
setting\&. This "propagates" the status of a rebuilt file so that other "downstream" target files will always be rebuilt, even if the contents or the timestamp have not changed\&.
.sp

"build"
signatures are fastest because
"content"
(or
"MD5") signatures take longer to compute, but are more accurate than
"timestamp"
signatures, and can prevent unnecessary "downstream" rebuilds when a target file is rebuilt to the exact same contents as the previous build\&. The
"source"
setting provides the most consistent behavior when other target files may be rebuilt from both source and target input files\&. The default value is
"source"\&.
.sp
Because the default setting is
"source", using
\fBSourceSignatures\fR
is generally preferable to
\fBTargetSignatures\fR, so that the up\-to\-date decision will be consistent for all files (or all files built with a specific construction environment)\&. Use of
\fBTargetSignatures\fR
provides specific control for how built target files affect their "downstream" dependencies\&.

Returns a Node object representing the specified Python value\&. Value Nodes can be used as dependencies of targets\&. If the result of calling
\fBstr\fR(\fIvalue\fR) changes between SCons runs, any targets depending on
\fBValue\fR(\fIvalue\fR) will be rebuilt\&. (This is true even when using timestamps to decide if files are up\-to\-date\&.) When using timestamp source signatures, Value Nodes\*(Aq timestamps are equal to the system time when the Node is created\&.
.sp
The returned Value Node object has a
\fBwrite\fR() method that can be used to "build" a Value Node by setting a new value\&. The optional

VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate]), env\&.VariantDir(variant_dir, src_dir, [duplicate])
.RS 4
Use the
\fBVariantDir\fR
function to create a copy of your sources in another location: if a name under
\fIvariant_dir\fR
is not found but exists under
\fIsrc_dir\fR, the file or directory is copied to
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. Target files can be built in a different directory than the original sources by simply refering to the sources (and targets) within the variant tree\&.
.sp

\fBVariantDir\fR
can be called multiple times with the same
\fIsrc_dir\fR
to set up multiple builds with different options (\fIvariants\fR)\&. The
\fIsrc_dir\fR
location must be in or underneath the SConstruct file\*(Aqs directory, and
\fIvariant_dir\fR
may not be underneath
\fIsrc_dir\fR\&.
.sp
The default behavior is for
scons
to physically duplicate the source files in the variant tree\&. Thus, a build performed in the variant tree is guaranteed to be identical to a build performed in the source tree even if intermediate source files are generated during the build, or preprocessors or other scanners search for included files relative to the source file, or individual compilers or other invoked tools are hard\-coded to put derived files in the same directory as source files\&.
.sp
If possible on the platform, the duplication is performed by linking rather than copying; see also the
\fB\-\-duplicate\fR
command\-line option\&. Moreover, only the files needed for the build are duplicated; files and directories that are not used are not present in
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&.
.sp
Duplicating the source tree may be disabled by setting the
duplicate
argument to
0
(zero)\&. This will cause
scons
to invoke Builders using the path names of source files in
\fIsrc_dir\fR
and the path names of derived files within
\fIvariant_dir\fR\&. This is always more efficient than
duplicate=1, and is usually safe for most builds (but see above for cases that may cause problems)\&.
.sp
Note that
\fBVariantDir\fR
works most naturally with a subsidiary SConscript file\&. However, you would then call the subsidiary SConscript file not in the source directory, but in the
\fIvariant_dir\fR, regardless of the value of
duplicate\&. This is how you tell
scons
which variant of a source tree to build:
.sp

Options added to the compiler command line to support storing debugging information in a Microsoft Visual C++ PDB file\&. The default value expands expands to appropriate Microsoft Visual C++ command\-line options when the
\fB$PDB\fR

.sp
The Visual C++ compiler option that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is
\fB/Z7\fR\&. This works correctly with parallel (\fB\-j\fR) builds because it embeds the debug information in the intermediate object files, as opposed to sharing a single PDB file between multiple object files\&. This is also the only way to get debug information embedded into a static library\&. Using the
\fB/Zi\fR
instead may yield improved link\-time performance, although parallel builds will no longer work\&.
.sp
You can generate PDB files with the
\fB/Zi\fR
switch by overriding the default
\fB$CCPDBFLAGS\fR
variable as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\

An alternative would be to use the

An automatically\-generated construction variable containing the Fortran compiler command\-line option for specifying the directory location where the Fortran compiler should place any module files that happen to get generated during compilation\&. The value of
\fB$_FORTRANMODFLAG\fR
is created by prepending/appending
\fB$FORTRANMODDIRPREFIX\fR

FORTRANMODPREFIX
.RS 4
The module file prefix used by the Fortran compiler\&. SCons assumes that the Fortran compiler follows the quasi\-standard naming convention for module files of
module_name\&.mod\&. As a result, this variable is left empty, by default\&. For situations in which the compiler does not necessarily follow the normal convention, the user may use this variable\&. Its value will be appended to every module file name as scons attempts to resolve dependencies\&.

FORTRANPATH
.RS 4
The list of directories that the Fortran compiler will search for include files and (for some compilers) module files\&. The Fortran implicit dependency scanner will search these directories for include files (but not module files since they are autogenerated and, as such, may not actually exist at the time the scan takes place)\&. Don\*(Aqt explicitly put include directory arguments in FORTRANFLAGS because the result will be non\-portable and the directories will not be searched by the dependency scanner\&. Note: directory names in FORTRANPATH will be looked\-up relative to the SConscript directory when they are used in a command\&. To force
scons

.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
env = Environment(FORTRANPATH=\*(Aq#/include\*(Aq)

The Visual C++ compiler switch that SCons uses by default to generate PDB information is

PRINT_CMD_LINE_FUNC
.RS 4
A Python function used to print the command lines as they are executed (assuming command printing is not disabled by the
\fB\-q\fR

options or their equivalents)\&. The function should take four arguments:
\fIs\fR, the command being executed (a string),
\fItarget\fR, the target being built (file node, list, or string name(s)),
\fIsource\fR, the source(s) used (file node, list, or string name(s)), and
\fIenv\fR, the environment being used\&.
.sp
The function must do the printing itself\&. The default implementation, used if this variable is not set or is None, is:
.sp

.sp

\fBAutomatic moc file generation from header files\&.\fR
You do not have to specify moc files explicitly, the tool does it for you\&. However, there are a few preconditions to do so: Your header file must have the same filebase as your implementation file and must stay in the same directory\&. It must have one of the suffixes \&.h, \&.hpp, \&.H, \&.hxx, \&.hh\&. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0\&. See also the corresponding
\fBMoc\fR() builder method\&.
.sp

\fBAutomatic moc file generation from cxx files\&.\fR
As stated in the qt documentation, include the moc file at the end of the cxx file\&. Note that you have to include the file, which is generated by the transformation ${QT_MOCCXXPREFIX}<basename>${QT_MOCCXXSUFFIX}, by default <basename>\&.moc\&. A warning is generated after building the moc file, if you do not include the correct file\&. If you are using VariantDir, you may need to specify duplicate=1\&. You can turn off automatic moc file generation by setting QT_AUTOSCAN to 0\&. See also the corresponding
\fBMoc\fR
builder method\&.
.sp

\fBAutomatic handling of \&.ui files\&.\fR
The implementation files generated from \&.ui files are handled much the same as yacc or lex files\&. Each \&.ui file given as a source of Program, Library or SharedLibrary will generate three files, the declaration file, the implementation file and a moc file\&. Because there are also generated headers, you may need to specify duplicate=1 in calls to VariantDir\&. See also the corresponding

\fBscons\fR
supports
\fIconfigure contexts,\fR
an integrated mechanism similar to the various AC_CHECK macros in GNU autoconf for testing for the existence of C header files, libraries, etc\&. In contrast to autoconf,
\fBscons\fR
does not maintain an explicit cache of the tested values, but uses its normal dependency tracking to keep the checked values up to date\&. However, users may override this behaviour with the
\fB\-\-config\fR
command line option\&.
.PP
The following methods can be used to perform checks:
.PP
Configure(\fIenv\fR, [\fIcustom_tests\fR, \fIconf_dir\fR, \fIlog_file\fR, \fIconfig_h\fR, \fIclean\fR, \fIhelp])\fR, env\&.Configure([\fIcustom_tests\fR, \fIconf_dir\fR, \fIlog_file\fR, \fIconfig_h\fR, \fIclean\fR, \fIhelp])\fR
.RS 4
This creates a configure context, which can be used to perform checks\&.
\fIenv\fR
specifies the environment for building the tests\&. This environment may be modified when performing checks\&.
\fIcustom_tests\fR
is a dictionary containing custom tests\&. See also the section about custom tests below\&. By default, no custom tests are added to the configure context\&.
\fIconf_dir\fR
specifies a directory where the test cases are built\&. Note that this directory is not used for building normal targets\&. The default value is the directory #/\&.sconf_temp\&.
\fIlog_file\fR
specifies a file which collects the output from commands that are executed to check for the existence of header files, libraries, etc\&. The default is the file #/config\&.log\&. If you are using the
\fBVariantDir\fR() method, you may want to specify a subdirectory under your variant directory\&.
\fIconfig_h\fR
specifies a C header file where the results of tests will be written, e\&.g\&. #define HAVE_STDIO_H, #define HAVE_LIBM, etc\&. The default is to not write a
\fBconfig\&.h\fR
file\&. You can specify the same
\fBconfig\&.h\fR
file in multiple calls to Configure, in which case
\fBscons\fR
will concatenate all results in the specified file\&. Note that SCons uses its normal dependency checking to decide if it\*(Aqs necessary to rebuild the specified
\fIconfig_h\fR
file\&. This means that the file is not necessarily re\-built each time scons is run, but is only rebuilt if its contents will have changed and some target that depends on the
\fIconfig_h\fR
file is being built\&.
.sp
The optional
\fBclean\fR
and
\fBhelp\fR
arguments can be used to suppress execution of the configuration tests when the
\fB\-c/\-\-clean\fR
or
\fB\-H/\-h/\-\-help\fR
options are used, respectively\&. The default behavior is always to execute configure context tests, since the results of the tests may affect the list of targets to be cleaned or the help text\&. If the configure tests do not affect these, then you may add the
\fBclean=False\fR
or
\fBhelp=False\fR
arguments (or both) to avoid unnecessary test execution\&.

.SS "Command\-Line Construction Variables"
.PP
Often when building software, some variables must be specified at build time\&. For example, libraries needed for the build may be in non\-standard locations, or site\-specific compiler options may need to be passed to the compiler\&.
\fBscons\fR
provides a
\fBVariables\fR
object to support overriding construction variables on the command line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ scons VARIABLE=foo
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The variable values can also be specified in a text\-based SConscript file\&. To create a Variables object, call the Variables() function:
.PP
Variables([\fIfiles\fR], [\fIargs\fR])
.RS 4
This creates a Variables object that will read construction variables from the file or list of filenames specified in
\fIfiles\fR\&. If no files are specified, or the
\fIfiles\fR
argument is
\fBNone\fR, then no files will be read\&. The optional argument
\fIargs\fR
is a dictionary of values that will override anything read from the specified files; it is primarily intended to be passed the
\fBARGUMENTS\fR
dictionary that holds variables specified on the command line\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
vars = Variables(\*(Aqcustom\&.py\*(Aq)
vars = Variables(\*(Aqoverrides\&.py\*(Aq, ARGUMENTS)
vars = Variables(None, {FOO:\*(Aqexpansion\*(Aq, BAR:7})

Variables objects have the following methods:
.RE
.PP
Add(\fIkey\fR, [\fIhelp\fR, \fIdefault\fR, \fIvalidator\fR, \fIconverter\fR])
.RS 4
This adds a customizable construction variable to the Variables object\&.
\fIkey\fR
is the name of the variable\&.
\fIhelp\fR
is the help text for the variable\&.
\fIdefault\fR
is the default value of the variable; if the default value is
\fBNone\fR
and there is no explicit value specified, the construction variable will
\fInot\fR
be added to the construction environment\&.
\fIvalidator\fR
is called to validate the value of the variable, and should take three arguments: key, value, and environment\&. The recommended way to handle an invalid value is to raise an exception (see example below)\&.
\fIconverter\fR
is called to convert the value before putting it in the environment, and should take either a value, or the value and environment, as parameters\&. The
\fIconverter\fR
must return a value, which will be converted into a string before being validated by the
\fIvalidator\fR
(if any) and then added to the environment\&.

\fBtarget\fR
(a Node object representing the target file),
\fBsource\fR
(a Node object representing the source file) and
\fBenv\fR
(the construction environment used for building the target file)\&. The
\fBtarget\fR
and
\fBsource\fR
arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is more than one target file or source file\&. The actual target and source file name(s) may be retrieved from their Node objects via the built\-in Python str() function:

.if n \{\

If the action argument is not one of the above, None is returned\&.
.RE
.PP
The second argument is optional and is used to define the output which is printed when the Action is actually performed\&. In the absence of this parameter, or if it\*(Aqs an empty string, a default output depending on the type of the action is used\&. For example, a command\-line action will print the executed command\&. The argument must be either a Python function or a string\&.
.PP
In the first case, it\*(Aqs a function that returns a string to be printed to describe the action being executed\&. The function may also be specified by the
\fIstrfunction\fR= keyword argument\&. Like a function to build a file, this function must take three keyword arguments:
\fBtarget\fR
(a Node object representing the target file),
\fBsource\fR
(a Node object representing the source file) and
\fBenv\fR
(a construction environment)\&. The
\fBtarget\fR
and
\fBsource\fR
arguments may be lists of Node objects if there is more than one target file or source file\&.
.PP
In the second case, you provide the string itself\&. The string may also be specified by the
\fIcmdstr\fR= keyword argument\&. The string typically contains variables, notably $TARGET(S) and $SOURCE(S), or consists of just a single variable, which is optionally defined somewhere else\&. SCons itself heavily uses the latter variant\&.
.PP
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

def build_it(target, source, env):
    # build the target from the source
    return 0

The third and succeeding arguments, if present, may either be a construction variable or a list of construction variables whose values will be included in the signature of the Action when deciding whether a target should be rebuilt because the action changed\&. The variables may also be specified by a
\fIvarlist\fR= keyword parameter; if both are present, they are combined\&. This is necessary whenever you want a target to be rebuilt when a specific construction variable changes\&. This is not often needed for a string action, as the expanded variables will normally be part of the command line, but may be needed if a Python function action uses the value of a construction variable when generating the command line\&.

The
\fBAction\fR() global function can be passed the following optional keyword arguments to modify the Action object\*(Aqs behavior:
.PP
\fBchdir\fR
The
\fBchdir\fR
keyword argument specifies that scons will execute the action after changing to the specified directory\&. If the
\fBchdir\fR
argument is a string or a directory Node, scons will change to the specified directory\&. If the
\fBchdir\fR
argument is not a string or Node and is non\-zero, then scons will change to the target file\*(Aqs directory\&.
.PP
Note that scons will
\fInot\fR
automatically modify its expansion of construction variables like
\fB$TARGET\fR
and
\fB$SOURCE\fR
when using the chdir keyword argument\-\-that is, the expanded file names will still be relative to the top\-level SConstruct directory, and consequently incorrect relative to the chdir directory\&. Builders created using chdir keyword argument, will need to use construction variable expansions like
\fB${TARGET\&.file}\fR
and
\fB${SOURCE\&.file}\fR
to use just the filename portion of the targets and source\&.

.if n \{\

.PP
\fBexitstatfunc\fR
The
\fBAction\fR() global function also takes an
\fBexitstatfunc\fR
keyword argument which specifies a function that is passed the exit status (or return value) from the specified action and can return an arbitrary or modified value\&. This can be used, for example, to specify that an Action object\*(Aqs return value should be ignored under special conditions and SCons should, therefore, consider that the action always suceeds:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def always_succeed(s):
    # Always return 0, which indicates success\&.
    return 0
a = Action("build < ${SOURCE\&.file} > ${TARGET\&.file}",
           exitstatfunc=always_succeed)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fBbatch_key\fR
The
\fBbatch_key\fR
keyword argument can be used to specify that the Action can create multiple target files by processing multiple independent source files simultaneously\&. (The canonical example is "batch compilation" of multiple object files by passing multiple source files to a single invocation of a compiler such as Microsoft\*(Aqs Visual C / C++ compiler\&.) If the
\fBbatch_key\fR
argument is any non\-False, non\-callable Python value, the configured Action object will cause
\fBscons\fR
to collect all targets built with the Action object and configured with the same construction environment into single invocations of the Action object\*(Aqs command line or function\&. Command lines will typically want to use the
\fBCHANGED_SOURCES\fR
construction variable (and possibly
\fBCHANGED_TARGETS\fR
as well) to only pass to the command line those sources that have actually changed since their targets were built\&.
.PP
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
a = Action(\*(Aqbuild $CHANGED_SOURCES\*(Aq, batch_key=True)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fBbatch_key\fR
argument may also be a callable function that returns a key that will be used to identify different "batches" of target files to be collected for batch building\&. A
\fBbatch_key\fR
function must take the following arguments:
.PP
action
.RS 4
The action object\&.
.RE
.PP
env
.RS 4
The construction environment configured for the target\&.
.RE
.PP
target
.RS 4
The list of targets for a particular configured action\&.
.RE
.PP
source
.RS 4
The list of source for a particular configured action\&.
.sp
The returned key should typically be a tuple of values derived from the arguments, using any appropriate logic to decide how multiple invocations should be batched\&. For example, a
\fBbatch_key\fR
function may decide to return the value of a specific construction variable from the
\fBenv\fR
argument which will cause
\fBscons\fR
to batch\-build targets with matching values of that variable, or perhaps return the
\fBid\fR() of the entire construction environment, in which case
\fBscons\fR
will batch\-build all targets configured with the same construction environment\&. Returning
\fBNone\fR
indicates that the particular target should
\fInot\fR
be part of any batched build, but instead will be built by a separate invocation of action\*(Aqs command or function\&. Example:
.sp
.if n \{\

In practice, there are two natural ways that these Action Functions are intended to be used\&.
.PP
First, if you need to perform the action at the time the SConscript file is being read, you can use the
\fBExecute\fR
global function to do so:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Execute(Touch(\*(Aqfile\*(Aq))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Second, you can use these functions to supply Actions in a list for use by the
\fBCommand\fR
method\&. This can allow you to perform more complicated sequences of file manipulation without relying on platform\-specific external commands: that
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

             Copy(\*(Aq$TMPBUILD\*(Aq, \*(Aq${SOURCE\&.dir}\*(Aq),
             "cd $TMPBUILD && make",
             Delete(\*(Aq$TMPBUILD\*(Aq)])
.fi
.if n \{\

Chmod(\fIdest\fR, \fImode\fR)
.RS 4
Returns an Action object that changes the permissions on the specified
\fIdest\fR

Copy(\fIdest\fR, \fIsrc\fR)
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
Delete(\fIentry\fR, [\fImust_exist\fR])
.RS 4
Returns an Action that deletes the specified
\fIentry\fR, which may be a file or a directory tree\&. If a directory is specified, the entire directory tree will be removed\&. If the
\fImust_exist\fR
flag is set, then a Python error will be thrown if the specified entry does not exist; the default is
\fBmust_exist=0\fR, that is, the Action will silently do nothing if the entry does not exist\&. Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Execute(Delete(\*(Aq/tmp/buildroot\*(Aq))

env\&.Command(\*(Aqfoo\&.out\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.in\*(Aq,

.SS "Variable Substitution"
.PP
Before executing a command,
\fBscons\fR
performs construction variable interpolation on the strings that make up the command line of builders\&. Variables are introduced by a
\fB$\fR
prefix\&. Besides construction variables, scons provides the following variables for each command execution:
.PP
CHANGED_SOURCES
.RS 4
The file names of all sources of the build command that have changed since the target was last built\&.
.RE
.PP
CHANGED_TARGETS
.RS 4
The file names of all targets that would be built from sources that have changed since the target was last built\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
The file name of the source of the build command, or the file name of the first source if multiple sources are being built\&.
.RE
.PP
SOURCES
.RS 4
The file names of the sources of the build command\&.
.RE
.PP
TARGET
.RS 4
The file name of the target being built, or the file name of the first target if multiple targets are being built\&.
.RE
.PP
TARGETS
.RS 4
The file names of all targets being built\&.
.RE
.PP

.RS 4
The file names of all sources of the build command that have

.RE
.PP

.RS 4
The file names of all targets that would be built from sources that have
\fInot\fR

.sp
(Note that the above variables are reserved and may not be set in a construction environment\&.)
.RE
.PP
For example, given the construction variable CC=\*(Aqcc\*(Aq, targets=[\*(Aqfoo\*(Aq], and sources=[\*(Aqfoo\&.c\*(Aq, \*(Aqbar\&.c\*(Aq]:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
action=\*(Aq$CC \-c \-o $TARGET $SOURCES\*(Aq
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
would produce the command line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
cc \-c \-o foo foo\&.c bar\&.c
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Variable names may be surrounded by curly braces ({}) to separate the name from the trailing characters\&. Within the curly braces, a variable name may have a Python slice subscript appended to select one or more items from a list\&. In the previous example, the string:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
${SOURCES[1]}
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
would produce:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
bar\&.c
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Additionally, a variable name may have the following special modifiers appended within the enclosing curly braces to modify the interpolated string:
.PP
base
.RS 4
The base path of the file name, including the directory path but excluding any suffix\&.
.RE
.PP
dir
.RS 4
The name of the directory in which the file exists\&.
.RE
.PP
file
.RS 4
The file name, minus any directory portion\&.
.RE
.PP
filebase
.RS 4
Just the basename of the file, minus any suffix and minus the directory\&.
.RE
.PP
suffix
.RS 4
Just the file suffix\&.
.RE
.PP
abspath
.RS 4
The absolute path name of the file\&.
.RE
.PP
posix
.RS 4
The POSIX form of the path, with directories separated by
\fB/\fR
(forward slashes) not backslashes\&. This is sometimes necessary on Windows systems when a path references a file on other (POSIX) systems\&.
.RE
.PP
srcpath
.RS 4
The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file through
\fBVariantDir\fR()\&. If this file isn\*(Aqt linked, it just returns the directory and filename unchanged\&.
.RE
.PP
srcdir
.RS 4
The directory containing the source file linked to this file through
\fBVariantDir\fR()\&. If this file isn\*(Aqt linked, it just returns the directory part of the filename\&.
.RE
.PP
rsrcpath
.RS 4
The directory and file name to the source file linked to this file through
\fBVariantDir\fR()\&. If the file does not exist locally but exists in a Repository, the path in the Repository is returned\&. If this file isn\*(Aqt linked, it just returns the directory and filename unchanged\&.
.RE
.PP
rsrcdir
.RS 4
The Repository directory containing the source file linked to this file through
\fBVariantDir\fR()\&. If this file isn\*(Aqt linked, it just returns the directory part of the filename\&.
.RE
.PP
For example, the specified target will expand as follows for the corresponding modifiers:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$TARGET              => sub/dir/file\&.x
${TARGET\&.base}       => sub/dir/file
${TARGET\&.dir}        => sub/dir
${TARGET\&.file}       => file\&.x
${TARGET\&.filebase}   => file
${TARGET\&.suffix}     => \&.x
${TARGET\&.abspath}    => /top/dir/sub/dir/file\&.x

SConscript(\*(Aqsrc/SConscript\*(Aq, variant_dir=\*(Aqsub/dir\*(Aq)
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file\&.x
${SOURCE\&.srcpath}    => src/file\&.x
${SOURCE\&.srcdir}     => src

Repository(\*(Aq/usr/repository\*(Aq)
$SOURCE              => sub/dir/file\&.x
${SOURCE\&.rsrcpath}   => /usr/repository/src/file\&.x
${SOURCE\&.rsrcdir}    => /usr/repository/src
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Note that curly braces braces may also be used to enclose arbitrary Python code to be evaluated\&. (In fact, this is how the above modifiers are substituted, they are simply attributes of the Python objects that represent TARGET, SOURCES, etc\&.) See the section "Python Code Substitution" below, for more thorough examples of how this can be used\&.
.PP
Lastly, a variable name may be a callable Python function associated with a construction variable in the environment\&. The function should take four arguments:
\fItarget\fR
\- a list of target nodes,
\fIsource\fR
\- a list of source nodes,
\fIenv\fR
\- the construction environment,
\fIfor_signature\fR
\- a Boolean value that specifies whether the function is being called for generating a build signature\&. SCons will insert whatever the called function returns into the expanded string:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
def foo(target, source, env, for_signature):
    return "bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="$FOO baz")
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
You can use this feature to pass arguments to a Python function by creating a callable class that stores one or more arguments in an object, and then uses them when the
\fB__call__()\fR
method is called\&. Note that in this case, the entire variable expansion must be enclosed by curly braces so that the arguments will be associated with the instantiation of the class:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
class foo(object):
    def __init__(self, arg):
        self\&.arg = arg

    def __call__(self, target, source, env, for_signature):
        return self\&.arg + " bar"

# Will expand $BAR to "my argument bar baz"
env=Environment(FOO=foo, BAR="${FOO(\*(Aqmy argument\*(Aq)} baz")
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The special pseudo\-variables
\fB$(\fR
and
\fB$)\fR
may be used to surround parts of a command line that may change
\fIwithout\fR
causing a rebuild\-\-that is, which are not included in the signature of target files built with this command\&. All text between
\fB$(\fR
and
\fB$)\fR
will be removed from the command line before it is added to file signatures, and the
\fB$(\fR
and
\fB$)\fR
will be removed before the command is executed\&. For example, the command line:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo Last build occurred $( $TODAY $)\&. > $TARGET
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
would execute the command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo Last build occurred $TODAY\&. > $TARGET
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
but the command signature added to any target files would be:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo Last build occurred  \&. > $TARGET
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SS "Python Code Substitution"
.PP
Any python code within
\fB${\fR\-\fB}\fR
pairs gets evaluated by python \*(Aqeval\*(Aq, with the python globals set to the current environment\*(Aqs set of construction variables\&. So in the following case:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env[\*(AqCOND\*(Aq] = 0
env\&.Command(\*(Aqfoo\&.out\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.in\*(Aq,
    \*(Aq\*(Aq\*(Aqecho ${COND==1 and \*(AqFOO\*(Aq or \*(AqBAR\*(Aq} > $TARGET\*(Aq\*(Aq\*(Aq)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
the command executed will be either
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo FOO > foo\&.out
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
or
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
echo BAR > foo\&.out
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
according to the current value of env[\*(AqCOND\*(Aq] when the command is executed\&. The evaluation occurs when the target is being built, not when the SConscript is being read\&. So if env[\*(AqCOND\*(Aq] is changed later in the SConscript, the final value will be used\&.
.PP
Here\*(Aqs a more interesting example\&. Note that all of COND, FOO, and BAR are environment variables, and their values are substituted into the final command\&. FOO is a list, so its elements are interpolated separated by spaces\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
env=Environment()
env[\*(AqCOND\*(Aq] = 0
env[\*(AqFOO\*(Aq] = [\*(Aqfoo1\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo2\*(Aq]
env[\*(AqBAR\*(Aq] = \*(Aqbarbar\*(Aq
env\&.Command(\*(Aqfoo\&.out\*(Aq, \*(Aqfoo\&.in\*(Aq,
    \*(Aqecho ${COND==1 and FOO or BAR} > $TARGET\*(Aq)

# Will execute this:
#  echo foo1 foo2 > foo\&.out
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
SCons uses the following rules when converting construction variables into command lines:
.PP
String
.RS 4
When the value is a string it is interpreted as a space delimited list of command line arguments\&.
.RE
.PP
List
.RS 4
When the value is a list it is interpreted as a list of command line arguments\&. Each element of the list is converted to a string\&.
.RE
.PP
Other
.RS 4
Anything that is not a list or string is converted to a string and interpreted as a single command line argument\&.
.RE
.PP
Newline
.RS 4
Newline characters (\en) delimit lines\&. The newline parsing is done after all other parsing, so it is not possible for arguments (e\&.g\&. file names) to contain embedded newline characters\&. This limitation will likely go away in a future version of SCons\&.
.RE
.SS "Scanner Objects"
.PP
You can use the
\fBScanner\fR
function to define objects to scan new file types for implicit dependencies\&. The
\fBScanner\fR
function accepts the following arguments:
.PP
function
.RS 4
This can be either: 1) a Python function that will process the Node (file) and return a list of File Nodes representing the implicit dependencies (file names) found in the contents; or: 2) a dictionary that maps keys (typically the file suffix, but see below for more discussion) to other Scanners that should be called\&.
.sp
If the argument is actually a Python function, the function must take three or four arguments:
.sp
def scanner_function(node, env, path):
.sp
def scanner_function(node, env, path, arg=None):
.sp
The
\fBnode\fR
argument is the internal SCons node representing the file\&. Use
\fBstr(node)\fR
to fetch the name of the file, and
\fBnode\&.get_contents()\fR
to fetch contents of the file\&. Note that the file is
\fInot\fR
guaranteed to exist before the scanner is called, so the scanner function should check that if there\*(Aqs any chance that the scanned file might not exist (for example, if it\*(Aqs built from other files)\&.
.sp
The
\fBenv\fR
argument is the construction environment for the scan\&. Fetch values from it using the
\fBenv\&.Dictionary()\fR
method\&.
.sp
The
\fBpath\fR
argument is a tuple (or list) of directories that can be searched for files\&. This will usually be the tuple returned by the
\fBpath_function\fR
argument (see below)\&.
.sp
The
\fBarg\fR

skeys
.RS 4
An optional list that can be used to determine which scanner should be used for a given Node\&. In the usual case of scanning for file names, this argument will be a list of suffixes for the different file types that this Scanner knows how to scan\&. If the argument is a string, then it will be expanded into a list by the current environment\&.
.RE
.PP
path_function
.RS 4
A Python function that takes four or five arguments: a construction environment, a Node for the directory containing the SConscript file in which the first target was defined, a list of target nodes, a list of source nodes, and an optional argument supplied when the scanner was created\&. The
\fBpath_function\fR
returns a tuple of directories that can be searched for files to be returned by this Scanner object\&. (Note that the
\fBFindPathDirs\fR() function can be used to return a ready\-made
\fBpath_function\fR
for a given construction variable name, instead of having to write your own function from scratch\&.)
.RE
.PP
node_class

The class of Node that should be returned by this Scanner object\&. Any strings or other objects returned by the scanner function that are not of this class will be run through the
\fBnode_factory\fR

.RE
.PP
node_factory
.RS 4
A Python function that will take a string or other object and turn it into the appropriate class of Node to be returned by this Scanner object\&.
.RE
.PP
scan_check
.RS 4
An optional Python function that takes two arguments, a Node (file) and a construction environment, and returns whether the Node should, in fact, be scanned for dependencies\&. This check can be used to eliminate unnecessary calls to the scanner function when, for example, the underlying file represented by a Node does not yet exist\&.
.RE
.PP
recursive
.RS 4
An optional flag that specifies whether this scanner should be re\-invoked on the dependency files returned by the scanner\&. When this flag is not set, the Node subsystem will only invoke the scanner on the file being scanned, and not (for example) also on the files specified by the #include lines in the file being scanned\&.
\fIrecursive\fR
may be a callable function, in which case it will be called with a list of Nodes found and should return a list of Nodes that should be scanned recursively; this can be used to select a specific subset of Nodes for additional scanning\&.
.RE
.PP
Note that
\fBscons\fR
has a global
\fBSourceFileScanner\fR
object that is used by the
\fBObject\fR(),
\fBSharedObject\fR(), and
\fBStaticObject\fR() builders to decide which scanner should be used for different file extensions\&. You can using the
\fBSourceFileScanner\&.add_scanner\fR() method to add your own Scanner object to the

infrastructure that builds target programs or libraries from a list of source files of different types:

SCons and its configuration files are very portable, due largely to its implementation in Python\&. There are, however, a few portability issues waiting to trap the unwary\&.
.SS "\&.C file suffix"
.PP
SCons handles the upper\-case
\fB\&.C\fR
file suffix differently, depending on the capabilities of the underlying system\&. On a case\-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, SCons treats a file with a
\fB\&.C\fR
suffix as a C++ source file\&. On a case\-insensitive system such as Windows, SCons treats a file with a
\fB\&.C\fR
suffix as a C source file\&.
.SS "\&.F file suffix"
.PP
SCons handles the upper\-case
\fB\&.F\fR
file suffix differently, depending on the capabilities of the underlying system\&. On a case\-sensitive system such as Linux or UNIX, SCons treats a file with a
\fB\&.F\fR
suffix as a Fortran source file that is to be first run through the standard C preprocessor\&. On a case\-insensitive system such as Windows, SCons treats a file with a
\fB\&.F\fR
suffix as a Fortran source file that should
\fInot\fR
be run through the C preprocessor\&.
.SS "Windows: Cygwin Tools and Cygwin Python vs\&. Windows Pythons"
.PP
Cygwin supplies a set of tools and utilities that let users work on a Windows system using a more POSIX\-like environment\&. The Cygwin tools, including Cygwin Python, do this, in part, by sharing an ability to interpret UNIX\-like path names\&. For example, the Cygwin tools will internally translate a Cygwin path name like /cygdrive/c/mydir to an equivalent Windows pathname of C:/mydir (equivalent to C:\emydir)\&.
.PP
Versions of Python that are built for native Windows execution, such as the python\&.org and ActiveState versions, do not have the Cygwin path name semantics\&. This means that using a native Windows version of Python to build compiled programs using Cygwin tools (such as gcc, bison, and flex) may yield unpredictable results\&. "Mixing and matching" in this way can be made to work, but it requires careful attention to the use of path names in your SConscript files\&.
.PP
In practice, users can sidestep the issue by adopting the following rules: When using gcc, use the Cygwin\-supplied Python interpreter to run SCons; when using Microsoft Visual C/C++ (or some other Windows compiler) use the python\&.org or ActiveState version of Python to run SCons\&.
.SS "Windows: scons\&.bat file"
.PP
On Windows systems, SCons is executed via a wrapper
\fBscons\&.bat\fR
file\&. This has (at least) two ramifications:
.PP
First, Windows command\-line users that want to use variable assignment on the command line may have to put double quotes around the assignments:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
scons "FOO=BAR" "BAZ=BLEH"
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Second, the Cygwin shell does not recognize this file as being the same as an
\fBscons\fR
command issued at the command\-line prompt\&. You can work around this either by executing
\fBscons\&.bat\fR
from the Cygwin command line, or by creating a wrapper shell script named
\fBscons \&.\fR
.SS "MinGW"
.PP
The MinGW bin directory must be in your PATH environment variable or the PATH variable under the ENV construction variable for SCons to detect and use the MinGW tools\&. When running under the native Windows Python interpreter, SCons will prefer the MinGW tools over the Cygwin tools, if they are both installed, regardless of the order of the bin directories in the PATH variable\&. If you have both MSVC and MinGW installed and you want to use MinGW instead of MSVC, then you must explicitly tell SCons to use MinGW by passing
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
tools=[\*(Aqmingw\*(Aq]
.fi
.if n \{\

to the Environment() function, because SCons will prefer the MSVC tools over the MinGW tools\&.

It is important to note that you have to return a list of File nodes from the scan function, simple strings for the file names won\*(Aqt do\&. As in the examples we are showing here, you can use the
\fBFile()\fR
function of your current Environment in order to create nodes on the fly from a sequence of file names with relative paths\&.

Here is a similar but more complete example that searches a path of directories (specified as the

construction variable) for files that actually exist:
.sp

        for dir in path:
            file = str(dir) + os\&.sep + inc
            if os\&.path\&.exists(file):
                results\&.append(file)

.if n \{\

The
\fBFindPathDirs\fR() function used in the previous example returns a function (actually a callable Python object) that will return a list of directories specified in the
\fB$MYPATH\fR
construction variable\&. It lets SCons detect the file
\fBincs/foo\&.inc\fR
, even if
\fBfoo\&.x\fR
contains the line
\fBinclude foo\&.inc\fR
only\&. If you need to customize how the search path is derived, you would provide your own
\fBpath_function\fR
argument when creating the Scanner object, as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
# MYPATH is a list of directories to search for files in

.SS "Using Microsoft Visual C++ precompiled headers"
.PP
Since windows\&.h includes everything and the kitchen sink, it can take quite some time to compile it over and over again for a bunch of object files, so Microsoft provides a mechanism to compile a set of headers once and then include the previously compiled headers in any object file\&. This technology is called precompiled headers\&. The general recipe is to create a file named "StdAfx\&.cpp" that includes a single header named "StdAfx\&.h", and then include every header you want to precompile in "StdAfx\&.h", and finally include "StdAfx\&.h" as the first header in all the source files you are compiling to object files\&. For example:
