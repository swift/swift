Prerequisites
------------
- GCC
- Python
- OpenSSL (and development package)
- Qt Open Source Edition (and development package. Optional; not needed for Swiften)

For Building
--------
- Swift uses Qt5 for the UI and on Unix-like platforms it is automatically detected
  using pkg-config.
- The dependencies can be installed by running ./BuildTools/InstallSwiftDependencies.sh
	Run 	./scons
- To build only a subdir, add the path as a target to scons. E.g., for Swift:
	Run	./scons Swift

For Running tests
-------------
- If you want to run the unit tests (only interesting if you're doing development work)
	Run	./scons test=unit
	for running the unit tests.

For Installing
----------
- To install Swift in /usr/local,
	Run	./scons SWIFT_INSTALLDIR=/usr/local /usr/local

For Swiften-only
------------
- To compile just Swiften, add Swiften to the end of the scons command
	Run	./scons Swiften
- To compile and install only Swiften, use SWIFTEN_INSTALLDIR
	Run	./scons SWIFTEN_INSTALLDIR=/usr/local /usr/local
