Prerequisites
------------
- GCC
- Python
- OpenSSL (and development package)
- Qt Open Source Edition (and development package. Optional; not needed for Swiften)

Building
--------
- Run 
		./scons
- To build only a subdir, add the path as a target to scons. E.g., for Swift:
		./scons Swift

It is recommended to build using Qt5, so add qt5=1 like this:
		./scons Swift qt5=1

Running tests
-------------
If you want to run the unit tests (only interesting if you're doing development work)
- Run
		./scons test=unit
	for running the unit tests.

Installing
----------
- To install swift in /usr/local, run
		./scons SWIFT_INSTALLDIR=/usr/local /usr/local

Swiften-only
------------
- To compile just Swiften, add Swiften to the end of the scons command
		./scons Swiften
- To compile and install only Swiften, use SWIFTEN_INSTALLDIR
		./scons SWIFTEN_INSTALLDIR=/usr/local /usr/local
